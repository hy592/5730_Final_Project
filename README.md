## Introduction
This project aims to design and implement an interactive audio spectrogram analyzer that leverages the capabilities of Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithms to analyze the spectrogram of real-time audio pieces and visually present on a gray-scaled VGA display. We also implemented a Python script to generate audio according to the given picture input. The generated audio contains many single-tone audios, with frequency and volume determined by the color depth of the image pixels. With these two designs, we are able to draw interesting pictures in our audio spectrogram analyzer, which is great fun to explore
